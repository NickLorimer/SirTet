# SirTet

For this assignment I had to consider the case of my crazy, but wealthy uncle, Sir Tet.
He had a huge pile of carpet tiles in the shapes of all the tetris pieces and wanted to know how many different ways he could completely fill his hallway with them leaving no gaps.

The limit for this problem was a hallway 200 tiles long and 6 tiles wide.
